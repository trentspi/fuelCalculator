# Python Fuel Calculator Application
**Description**: 
  This application was created as the final project for the IUPUI CSCI 23000 course. Fuel Calculator can help you monitor how many Miles to the Gallon your car is travelling, while also saving your fueling data in a table.

**Purpose**:
  Fuel Calculator is intended for anyone with a vehicle. Having such a calculator will allow for people to understand how many miles their car will travel per gallon of given gas. This can be extremely useful for those trying to conserve fuel usage and maximize the amount of distance travelled for their money. However, many modern cars will display the average MPG during travels. This application is still useful because the extensive data entries can show the user over an extended period of time exact calculation points. Such monitoring capabilities are more powerful than an average MPG display given from a car dashboard. This application is also a very nice tool for displaying the amount of money spent on gas per fill, how the average prices of gas fluctuate, and how many miles on average are added to the odometer per fill.
